# RECURSION

## WHY USE RECURSION

- It's everywhere
  - JSON turned into js
  - document.getElementById & DOM traversal algorithms
  - Object Traversal

## CALL STACK

- Call Stack is a data structure that manages what happens when functions are invoked

## HOW RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS WORK

- invoke the same function until you reach your base case

  - Base Case
    - the condition when the recursive function ends

- two essential parts
  - base case
  - different input
